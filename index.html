      <div class="accordion-question">What is IYENGAR Yoga <span class="accordion-toggle">+</span></div>
      <div class="accordion-answer">Iyengar Yoga, is named for B. K. S. Iyengar and described in his bestselling book Light on Yoga (1966). This style has an emphasis on detail, precision and alignment; using props in the performance of yoga postures 
       such as belts, blocks, and blankets, as aids for getting into poses correctly, minimizing the risk of injury or strain. Teachers receive extensive training, measured in years, not hours.  While we have other forms of yoga at Yoga Sarana but we keep the foundations set in Iyengar in everything we do. </div>
